a function InsertWordInto which takes one parameter of type string. This parameter can contain a set of words separated by a space, a single word, or an empty string.

The InsertWordInto function returns a new function that also accepts a parameter (not an empty string).

A call to an internal function inserts its argument values at any place (beginning, end) of a string that was passed to an external function.

If an internal function inserts a word in the middle of a string, it can only insert words instead of spaces, without changing the words themselves.

A word that is inserted into a string has spaces on each side.
